## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended for managing dependencies)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roninazure/OptiViz.git
   cd OptiViz

	2.	Set Up a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv optiviz_env
source optiviz_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `optiviz_env\Scripts\activate`


	3.	Install Required Packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

	Note: Make sure requirements.txt includes dependencies such as yfinance, pandas, numpy, plotly, and scipy.

Usage

	1.	Run the Main Script:

python optiviz.py


	2.	Enter a Stock Symbol: When prompted, enter the symbol of the stock you wish to analyze (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla).
	3.	Explore the Volatility Surface:
	•	The tool generates a 3D implied volatility surface plot.
	•	Higher volatility areas are highlighted in red, indicating regions of interest for options traders.
	•	Adjust the viewpoint and zoom to analyze different parts of the volatility surface.

Sample Output

Upon entering a stock symbol, you’ll see something like:

Enter the stock symbol (e.g., SPY): SPY
Found 24 expiration dates for SPY.
The chart goes out to approximately 12.0 months (48.0 weeks) in the future.

A plot will then open, displaying the implied volatility surface.

Examples

	•	Basic Analysis:
	•	Enter the symbol AAPL to view Apple’s implied volatility surface over the next several months.
	•	Comparing Stocks:
	•	Run the script with symbols of interest and observe variations in volatility for tech vs. industrial stocks.
